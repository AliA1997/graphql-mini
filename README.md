## Star Wars + GraphQL / Apollo / React

### Server Dependencies
- `express`
- `body-parser`
- `axios`   
- `express-graphql`
- `cors`

### Client Dependencies
- `apollo-boost`: Package containing everything you need to set up Apollo Client
- `react-apollo`: View layer integration for React
- `graphql-tag`: Necessary for parsing your GraphQL queries
- `graphql`: Also parses your GraphQL queries

### API we're using
- [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/)

### Project Summary  
- In this project we will use GraphQL Query Language to structure our data on the server and Apollo to interact with GraphQL on the client (app). We will interact with a traditional RESTful API `Star Wars` and translate it into GraphQL.  
- For basic styling and organization we have some files and folders provided for us. Lets get familiar with the structure 
- `server/graphql/model.js` is where our data for this project is stored, and it was pulled from the [Star Wars](https://swapi.co/) API.
